# Elevate SEO for WordPress
Welcome to the official GIT repository for the Elevate SEO and performance monitoring plugin for WordPress.

There are two branches:

* master - represents new, mostly untested code, typically the current prep work for the next version. That said, it is auto-deployed to about five live servers, so it should be mostly working
* release - represents stable code, typically the latest version also in the wordpress.org repository

## Official website
You can read more about Elevate, and also find detailed usage and installation instructions, over at https://elevatewp.io

## WordPress repository
Elevate SEO is also hosted in the official WordPress.org repository at https://wordpress.org/plugins/elevate-seo/. For stable releases, that repository will always trump this one.  But for state-of-the-art, this repository wins.
